# Layoffs Data Cleaning and Exploration (SQL)

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a layoffs dataset using SQL. It consists of two main scripts:
1. **PROJECT 1 – Data Cleaning**  
   Prepares and standardizes the raw dataset for analysis by handling duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formatting.  
2. **PROJECT 2 – Exploratory Analysis**  
   Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, key statistics, and company-level insights from the cleaned dataset.

## Files
- `PROJECT 1_Data_Cleaning.sql` – Cleans and preprocesses the raw data.  
- `PROJECT2_Exploratory_Analysis.sql` – Conducts exploratory queries and trend analyses.

## Key Features
- Duplicate detection and removal using `ROW_NUMBER()`.
- Data standardization (e.g., trimming whitespace, fixing inconsistent categories).
